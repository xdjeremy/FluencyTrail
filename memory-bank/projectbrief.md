# Project Brief: FluencyTrail

*This document is the foundation for the FluencyTrail project. It defines the core requirements, goals, and scope. All other Memory Bank files build upon this brief.*

## 1. Project Overview

FluencyTrail is a web application built with RedwoodJS designed to help users track their language learning activities. It aims to provide structure and motivation for learners by allowing them to log various types of immersion (watching, reading, listening, etc.) and potentially other activities like grammar study or vocabulary building.

## 2. Core Goals

*   **Track Language Learning Activities:** Allow users to log duration, type, language, and optionally associated media (movies, TV shows, books) for their learning sessions.
*   **Motivate Learners:** Encourage consistency and provide a sense of progress through visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, streaks - inferred from dependencies and README) and potentially social features.
*   **Social Sharing (Potential):** Enable users to share their progress or stats with others (based on user input).

## 3. Target Audience

*   Language learners seeking structure, motivation, and visibility into their progress.
*   Includes active learners, immersion enthusiasts, and those focused on tracking incremental achievements.

## 4. Key Features (High-Level)

*   **User Accounts:** Secure registration, login (email/password and OAuth - Google/GitHub), profile management, email verification, password reset.
*   **Activity Logging:** Record various types of language learning activities (watching, reading, listening, grammar, vocabulary, etc.) with details like duration, notes, date, and language.
*   **Media Integration:** Link activities to specific media items (movies, TV shows, books) potentially sourced from external databases.
*   **Progress Tracking & Visualization:** Display user progress through metrics and visualizations (e.g., heatmaps).
*   **Language Management:** Allow users to specify their primary language and the languages they are learning.
