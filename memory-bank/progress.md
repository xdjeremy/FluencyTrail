## 4. Known Issues

### Critical Issues
*   None currently identified

### Non-Critical Issues
*   Language selector in activity form could benefit from better UX
*   Dashboard components need refactoring for language support
*   Consider performance optimization for users with many languages

## 5. Project Evolution

### Recent Decisions
*   Implemented required language selection for activities
*   Used Cell pattern for language data fetching
*   Required primary language for users
*   Added language management to user settings

### Changed/Abandoned Approaches
*   Initially considered optional language field, changed to required
*   Moved from direct language prop passing to Cell pattern for better data management
*   Simplified language selection UI based on user feedback

### Lessons Learned
*   Cell pattern effectively manages data dependencies
*   Language requirements affect multiple system components
*   User experience benefits from clear language management

## 6. Next Steps
