# Product Context: FluencyTrail

*This document describes the "why" behind FluencyTrail. It details the problems the application solves, how it should function from a user perspective, and the desired user experience.*

## 1. Problem Statement

Language learners often struggle with maintaining consistency and tracking their progress across diverse activities (immersion, study, practice). It can be difficult to see the overall picture and stay motivated without a structured way to log efforts and visualize achievements.

## 2. Proposed Solution

FluencyTrail provides a centralized platform for language learners to log all their learning activities, associate them with specific media or study types, and track time spent. By visualizing this data (e.g., through heatmaps, streaks), it offers insights into progress and encourages consistent engagement, helping users stay motivated on their path to fluency.

## 3. User Personas / Stories

*(Describe the target users in more detail. What are their goals, motivations, and typical scenarios when using the app?)*

*   **Persona 1:** (e.g., Language Learner)
    *   Goals: ...
    *   Needs: ...
    *   Scenario: ...
*   **Persona 2:** (e.g., Polyglot)
    *   Goals: ...
    *   Needs: ...
    *   Scenario: ...

## 4. Functional Requirements (User Perspective)

*   **Feature: Activity Tracking**
    *   Users should be able to easily log language immersion activities (e.g., watching movies, reading books, listening) and study sessions (grammar, vocabulary).
    *   Logging should include language, duration, date, optional notes, and optionally link to a specific movie, TV show, or book.
    *   The system should calculate and display total immersion time based on logged activities.
*   **Feature: Progress Visualization**
    *   Users should see clear visualizations of their activity consistency, such as a heatmap showing logged days/time.
    *   Display streaks or other motivational metrics based on logged activities.
*   **Feature: User Accounts**
    *   Users need secure login via email/password or OAuth providers (Google, GitHub).
    *   Users should be able to manage their profile (e.g., name, timezone, primary language, learned languages).
    *   Implement email confirmation and password reset functionality.
*   **Feature: Media Discovery (Implied)**
    *   Users should potentially be able to search for or add media items (movies, TV, books) to link to their activities.

## 5. User Experience (UX) Goals

*(What kind of experience should users have? e.g., intuitive, motivating, simple, data-rich.)*

*   Goal 1: Make activity logging quick and effortless.
*   Goal 2: Provide clear and motivating feedback on progress.
*   Goal 3: Ensure a clean and uncluttered interface.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements (Product Focus)

*(Are there any product-related constraints or requirements like performance expectations, accessibility standards, etc.?)*

*   Requirement 1: ...

*(This document should evolve as our understanding of user needs and product direction refines.)*
