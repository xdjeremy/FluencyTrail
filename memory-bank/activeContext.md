# Active Context: FluencyTrail

*This document tracks the current focus of development, recent significant changes, immediate next steps, and active decisions. It's the most dynamic part of the Memory Bank.*

## 1. Current Focus

*   **Task:** Initialize the Memory Bank.
*   **Goal:** Establish the core documentation structure (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 2. Recent Changes (Last Session/Significant Updates)

*   *(Record major changes made recently. Since this is initialization, this section is currently empty.)*
*   N/A - Initializing Memory Bank.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps

*   Complete the creation of the core Memory Bank files.
    *   Create `systemPatterns.md`.
    *   Create `techContext.md`.
    *   Create `progress.md`.
*   Begin populating the Memory Bank files with initial project details based on the existing codebase and user input.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Decision: Using Markdown for Memory Bank files for readability and ease of editing.
*   Consideration: How detailed should the initial population of the Memory Bank be? Start broad and refine?

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   *(Note any recurring coding patterns, architectural choices, or user preferences that are currently relevant.)*
*   Pattern: Follow the structure defined in the user's custom instructions for the Memory Bank.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

*   *(Capture any new understanding or insights gained during the current work.)*
*   Insight: Establishing the Memory Bank structure first provides a clear framework for documenting the project.

*(This file MUST be updated frequently, ideally at the start and end of work sessions or after significant changes.)*
